"Q. Having pain in left ovary, and it increases during exercise. Is it ovarian cancer? Hi doctor, I am a 33 years old female, and I have had three c-sections and normal regular periods. My menstrual cycle three months back was short and lighter, and I ovulated about a week early. I noticed some pain, which almost reminded me of implantation pain. This continued on and off with pain and twinges. I thought maybe I was in early stages of pregnancy. Then I started having pelvic pain and lower left ovary area pain, which continued throughout the week. When I would push to have a bowel movement it hurts. I really thought I was pregnant. The fullness and achiness reminded me of early pregnancy. My most recent period was three days late. I went in and saw my OB yesterday. He did an exam and a transvaginal ultrasound, and he said everything looked fine. He tried to recreate the pain by touching some spots. Ever since then, my ovary pain on the left has been through the roof. What is going on? I am terrified I have ovarian cancer. Would he have been able to tell yesterday? What else could be going on? It hurts right around the ovary area and in the groin crease area.","Hi. After undergoing three cesarean sections, it is quite possible to have intra-abdominal adhesions. Which may give rise to intermittent pain associated with the bowel movements. Hope your bowel habits are regular and you do not have a problem of sticky stools. As there are multiple organs inside an abdomen, other causes of such pain should be ruled out. Hope this advice helps you. Take care and get back to me in need. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

What causes a recurring lump above eyebrow? My son had a cyst removed from his eyebrow surgically due to it s size and sudden rapid onset of growth. He has had the small cyst which formed when he was just weeks old. My mother left a remote control on top of the couch and it slid down striking the infant just above the right eyebrow. It formed an approximately 1/2 cm round lump. This gradually increased in size as he aged. Suddenly at 14 the area began to hurt him and grew to about 1 cm in size. I was able to freely move the lump. He complained it was sore. I took him to a local surgeon and the cyst was removed. It had begun to become in-twined in a literal ball of hair. It has been approximately 1 year since the surgery. There site healed well with no scar tissue and no further presence of the cyst could be palpated. A few weeks ago he had me feel the scar and I can again palpate approximately 1/2 cm lump again. Is this an issue that will recur over and over again? Should I have it removed again?,Hi...I have just gone through your query in detail. By what you quote it seems to be a recurrent sebaceous cyst and it needs to be removed as it can get secondarily infected.I suggest you get it excised.regards - Dr. Sumanth

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

"Can klebsiella oxytoca be treated with Norfloxacin? Can Klebsiella oxytoca by treated with Norfloxacine? My girlfriend age 71 is treated for Klebsiella Oxytoca with Norfloxacine, but after 10 days using it, she has now much pain in here uretra and bladder. Here doctor refuse to give here more Norfloxacine.","Hi.After having gone through the history given in your query, I am of the opinion that your beloved girl friend seems to be suffering from Norfloxacin resistant urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella species.The urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella oxytoca can be very serious since the bacteria have a greater possibility for resistance to antibiotics.The choice of a specific antimicrobial agent depends on the culture and sensitivity of the urine sample. Usually  3rd-generation cephalosporins ( cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin), & quinolones are found to be effective in Norfloxacin resistant infections. These agents may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy like a combination of Gentamicin & Ceftriaxone. If she is allergic to Ceftriazone, Aztreonam or Quinolones are the alternative effective antibiotics.So, she needs an immediate culture and sensitivity test for her urine sample to select the most suitable antibiotics to eradicate the Klebsiella infection."

I am sure it is a cervical cyst because I am positive I had one once before.

I wish there was a warning when the pain will occur and if there is any thing to help relieve the pain (though it does last for @ 15 min each time it happens) I feel like pulling my hair (and teeth) out while the pain occurs :","Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..As per your complain such a severe pain that lasts for about 15 minutes that seems to be episodic pain seems to be most probably due to nerve related pain..In case if it is due to sinuses it can be due to sinus infection or inflammation leading to Sinusitis..It would however be associated with other symptoms of Sinusitis along with pain..Trigeminal Neuralgia that is a disorder of Trigeminal neuralgia which is also known as nerve of face can be a cause for such a severe pain..You need to consult a Neurophysician and get evaluated for the exact cause of the pain by getting an MRI done as there can be some causes like the most common one is a large artery impinging over the nerve causing damage of the Myelin Sheath [ a protective cover over the nerve] leading to severe electric shock like pain..Other causes are disorders like Multiple sclerosis, tumour compressing the nerve, physical trauma etc..The common drugs given to relieve neurotic pain are Carbamazipine that is the first line drug while others like Gabapaentin, baclofen, oxycarbazipine etc but in case if the pain does not subside then surgical procedures like Microvascular decompression in which the compression over the artery is surgically removed is done..Other procedures like Balloon decompression,gama knife radiosurgery, glycerol injection etc can be done to relieve pain..Hope this helps..Regards"
"What causes gum bleeding? A while ago after brushing my teeth, I was spitting out a orange color blood.  it has always been red before.  The spot this came from is upper jaw on left side where I have an eye tooth that never came through.  I am now 47.  My teeth on both sides of where the eyetooth should be are very sensitive to eating, drinking or even touching.","Hello,It looks like a gum infection that is leading to bleeding from gums on brushing. Sensitive teeth and gum bleeding is probably due to gum infection or gingivitis. So my suggestion is to consult an oral physician, and get evaluated and a thorough clinical examination can be done followed by an x-ray to rule out the severity of the infection.If it is due to gum infection then a deep ultrasonic scaling can be done followed by a course of antibiotics like Metronidazole and massage the gums with Chlorohexidine gel. Do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora"

"What causes pinching feeling at one spot on buttock? Possibly sciatic problem?I feel a pinch, almost like a cramping feeling in one specific spot in my left buttock. It is constant and does not feel better or worse at any time or with any stretching or movement. this has been going on for two days straight with no end in sight. I've had sciatic problems years ago and it radiated down my leg, extremely painful, until an injection fixed it immediately. I can't remember if this is how it started. what I remember most is the excruciating pain down my leg.I am 33 years old, female, with osteoarthritis in both hands, plantar fasciitis in both feet, and narrowing of my lower spine as found in x-rays after a couple years of back pain which is still an issue. Can this pinch be the beginning of the sciatic problem which will make its way down my leg again?? It's not that it hurts too bad to function, more like it hurts so bad because it has been hurting for SO long already that makes it seem more painful.","Hi there,welcome to HCM.Thank you for your question.Pinching like sensation in the buttcoks may be due to spinal and non spinal Condtions. L5/S1 disc(which is the lower most functioning cushion like structure in your spine) degeneration can cause buttock pain with or with out pressure on your neves. During early part pain can only be restricted to buttock , with time there can be radiation of pain to back of thigh.It may or may not become associated with numbness also.An X ray might show dc reset space between the L5 and S1 bone providing an in direct evidence of disc degeneration.IIf the symptoms persist for longer than 6  weeks or if the pain is unrelenting in spite of medications  and physiotherapy and MRI might be indicated which has is more Conclusive. Spinal related pain can be one sidedo as in your case  or it might affect both sides.Non spinal buttock related pain is  usually one sided. Ischial bursitis which is inflammation of the covering of one of the muscles/ischial Bone on which we usually sit, can cause focal pain over the point of the buttock. Inflammation around the sciatic nerve in the buttook can also cause similar pain. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint what is is a joint between the pelvic and the spinal bones can also result in similar pain.If your pain as been there for more than 6 weeks it would be worthwhile to get radiological and blood tests done to rule out the above Conditions. I would suggest you to meet your physician and get evaluated so that these Conditions can be ruled out. In the mean time physiotherapy,strechtes,anti inflammatory and analgesic mediations can help you tied over the pain. Hope your queries are answeredAll the bestWith best regards DR.SBK"

"Q. Prepuce is not getting retracted during erection. What can I do for it? Hello doctor,I am a medical student, and I came across phimosis. My prepuce can be retracted easily and normally but when I get erect it does not retracts on own and even if I do it forcibly it gets stuck around corona which is painful. Is this a problem? If yes can I do something on my own and if I need a radical therapy, should I wait till my marriage?","Hello. Welcome to the icliniq.com. In a flaccid state, the foreskin can be retracted back over the shaft of the penis easily even in phimosis case. However, you have a problem in erection state as well, and hence you have mild degree phimosis. For that topical steroid cream can be used after consultation with your dermatologist. If it does not help, then you can selectively undergo one daycare surgery that is circumcision. But it is an elective operation, which means the procedure can be done anytime as per your convenience. I hope I have solved your query."

"Q. What is the best option other than braces to fill the gap of missing upper left canine? Hello doctor, I have an impacted tooth in the roof of my mouth and I do not have a top left canine. What are my options to fill the gap? A bridge or an implant? Or anything else? Not braces please and the fewer appointments are better.","Hi. First of all, I need to know your age. The treatment plan varies according to the age factor. Secondly, the impacted tooth no matter where it is, it should be 100% removed. This is done to reduce the possibility of complications in the future. It cannot even form a cyst, abscess, etc., because it is prone to infections. Only after the removal and depending on the remaining space restoration options are considered. If you are young, then braces option will give you the best result because it does not involve grinding of teeth. Plus it gives you a permanent result. Even though the time frame is more for the treatment, it is worth it. Next is the bridge option. Here, there is grinding of teeth on either side of the gap. Reliable but why do you want to unnecessarily grind the teeth which might make your teeth sensitive when the bridge fails in the long run. Then you got to fix it again. Double expense. Implant is a good option. This depends on how sound is your jaw bone and for canines, it is mostly not considered because of the difficulty in imitating the natural aesthetics. For a detailed and customized treatment plan please visit your dentist and discuss the best option that suits your age and the quality of bone."

Suggest remedy for ankle swelling I broke my ankle in Sep 2013. I had 2 screws and a device similar to a sling put in it. I began walking on it in Dec and had no pain until I started Cardiac rehab in Apr 2014. A recent xray says On the present examination metallic screws noted at the medial malleolus and the Union is incomplete at the medial malleolar fracture. Degenerative changes of right ankle noted with overlying soft tissue swelling . What can be done to help this ankle heal?,"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you,As you mentioned you had a fracture at the ankle joint and for which the surgery was performed, till now i feel the healing is not completed as the callus is not formed at the fracture site, also, this is completely a physiological process and a body's call for healing. Taking an oral calcium supplement prescribed by your physician must be taken and also some exercises advised. Since the location of the bone is weight bearing there will be changes in the joint structure, and function. So now the question is of swelling here, as you mentioned you have a degenerative changes in the right ankle, it is needed to allow the venous return to happen and reduce the swelling for which, dipping the feet in hot water and performing ankle toe movements while placing the feet over the pillow above the level of heart. Post this, some lower leg strengthening exercises are also needed to make the muscles of the lower limb stronger. As we do not know your age yet, if you are having any hypertension, then swelling is because of slow cardio, so the cardio rehab has to be performed but without weight bearing.

Suggest remedy for thyroid problem in pregnancy Hi. I have graves disease and 8 months ago had rai which successfully destroyed my thyroid. I am a few weeks pregnant and although my t4 is normal 16.6 my tsh is 5.75 - this is the lowest so far. I know about the probs with a high tsh and I will be monitored more later all going well. Is there a cause for concern at this moment.,"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.I first want to reassure you that women can and do have healthy pregnancies with thyroid disease all the time. In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high.But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development.So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine.  It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH.Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the abay grows.So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy.I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring.Best wishes fo rthe rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"

"Cause of buttock soreness after Zumba workout? Hello. I think I may have torn/pulled/strained either my glute, hamstring, or adductor. After an intense Zumba workout (so very,very warm) I did a side split. I have been working on getting further into it, stubbornly determined I will do it again, like I could when I was young (I am about to turn 43). Anyway, I pushed down almost to the floor when I heard and felt a double pop in the left, front facing leg/butt region. It is high at the base of my butt cheek. Feels like maybe where the ham attaches to the anterior of the pelvis???? Anyway, iced it when I got home and slept on it. This morning, I can walk, with a slight compensation, but can not sit on that side. Very sore on the underside, and a little in the ""mid cheek"" to left side. It is also kind of pulling around the front so there is some soreness/pain in the hip flexor. I am very active. Will I have to curtail all activity, or just stay away from stretching? How long might this take to heal? Do I need to be seen by a doc?",I understand your description. First you need to decrease your exercise activity. Second you should apply topical cream of antiinflammatory and analgesics for 10 days. You maynot need doctor if you start in the previous treatment and prophylaxis.

"Q. Ever since I had shoulder surgery, I have been unable to sleep like earlier. Please help. Hello doctor, I am a 31 year old male. Avid weightlifter and I currently weigh about 208 lbs. Ever since I had shoulder surgery, I have been unable to sleep like earlier. I used to fall asleep wherever I was and stay asleep until multiple alarms would go off. These days, I am not able to sleep properly. I sleep for about one to two hours at a time, then wake up and then again sleep. I do this the whole night. It makes me quite tired the next day. I have had multiple sleep studies done and there is no apnea or lack of oxygen. I have also tried tablet Ambien 12.5 mg and that gets me to three to four hours of sleep without waking up. But, I take that only on those days I know I can stay in bed for more than eight hours to make sure I am not groggy. It does not truly knock me out/make me sleep. I have also tried Melatonin and Benadryl which showed no effects. I have also tried Buspar to see if that helped. No real effect either. I am getting stumped as to why my sleep cycle has changed and why nothing is working. Please help.","Hi. Sleep problems are mainly due to either psychological issues or actual physical problems in the body. Before actually going to the causes of physical problems, I need to know if there are any psychological issue bothering you. Start taking capsule Omeprazole 20 mg every night half an hour before your dinner for two weeks and observe the response (this is an antacid medication and not a sleeping pill). You had mentioned about your shoulder surgery. Are you on any medications for that? Or any other pain medicines?  Also, you can ask your doctor for a prescription of tablet Zolpidem 10 mg every night which will give you a good sleep. But again, this is a temporary fix. We need to find the root cause to cure it.

"How to avoid transmission of infection after accidental needle prick? Hi Doctor,My wife got an accidental prick after administering insulin to her mother who is currently down with liver failure due to water filling her stomach every few days.       I am also listing below her 63 year old (frail, weak and weighing 39Kgs/80lbs) mom's medical histroy below for your ref:1.  Suffering from Asthama for over 30 years...........  2. Diagnosed with Breast Cancer 5 years ago ....  treated with laser and has been sort of been contained fortunately two years back and not currently spreading.3.  Diagnosed with Hepatitis 'C' 4 years ago... and under treatement. About 4 months back her belly started to fill with water and had to be removed every 1 month twice and later every 15days and now every 7-10days.....Doctors are advising to have a TIPS procedure done to let the water out continously.4. Diagnosed 4 months back with high sugar levels and advised to administer insulin regularly.Please advise, what should my wife do immediately to ensure she is not getting any infection from her mom's used insulin needle? Thanx","Good day and thanks for your question.  From your story the only transmissible infection your wife can contract from her mother is Hepatitis C. Asthma, breast cancer and high sugar levels cannot be transmitted through needle prick. However the risk of contracting hepatitis C via needle prick (insulin needle) is extremely low. No need to panic my dear brother. However you can take her to the hospital, she will do a baseline test on Hepatitis C (anti-HCV and liver function test especially alanine amino transferase) and the test is repeated 4-6 weeks after. Hope it helps. Thank you."

I have been about 50 pounds overweight for years, but this is different...it looks and feels different.  Could it be some type of ""fat tumor""...or is it just plain fat?  Should I be concerned?","Hi ! Good evening. i am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would not opine on your condition without getting you examined clinically specially your abdomen. What you have described could simply be a hernia, or any intra abdominal condition. To know the exact status of your condition, you need to be examined clinically preferably by a surgeon along with any special investigations like an ultrasound/CT scan as suggested by him to support his clinical findings. Therefore, I would at present suggest you to get your self assessed first by your family physician, and by a general surgeon if considered necessary by him.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."

"What could cause burning pain in the left thigh in a 73-year-old female suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis? Hello Dr. Rynne, I am a 73 year old female with lumbar spinal stenosis. I am suffering from left thigh frontal burning pain, and recently bruising. What would my condition be..The doctors I have seen have bot made a diagnosis. Thank you kindly, Irene Kiffe","Hi, I am happy to answer your question but letting you know that burning in the left thigh can definitely be caused by spinal canal stenosis of the lumbar portion of the column by compressing anything from L1-L3 (Lumbar 1- Lumbar 3 nerve roots). The best way to relieve this sensation is to first undergo physical therapy to try and release the compressive forces through activity, massage, etc.  Then, there are medications that can lessen the pain. Finally, if none of those methods relieves your symptoms it is possible that surgery can be performed, however, this is dependent upon how severe the canal stenosis is and how long the stenotic portion is since it is too long the surgery may produce worse pain symptoms during recovery than what you already have. It is a dilemma to be sure. But just attack it step by step. Save surgery for last in my opinion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"
"What causes shortness of breath along with racing heart beats? About 3 months ago I started having for the first time in my life anxiety attacks. My symptoms were shortness of breath, racing heart and body tingles. The tingles always started in my stomach and worked their way up my body. In a full blown attack I was tingling from my face to my stomach. I lose use of both hands during an attack because they both draw. Fast forward 2 months. On November 10th I woke up with pain in my shoulder blade. 3 weeks later I presented to the ER because the pain / spasms were just unbearable. In the ER last night they did a CT scan which revealed C5, C6 and C7 were bulging. My question is this...is there a correlation between bulging discs and panic attacks? Could the attacks I started having 3 months ago have been due to the discs in my neck?","DearWelcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Bulging discs do not have corelation with anxiety attacks. But shoulder blade pain has. Panic attacks are always due to an underlying anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder is fear related. Whenever your body fears, or becoming anxious, body uses a defense mechanism which causes stretching of neck, shoulder and chest muscles, palpitation and heavy breathing to make the body ready for the next eventuality. After this, when the body relaxes, the muscles feel sore and it starts paining. This is a natural procedure. Understandingt the ''fight or flight syndrome'' helps. If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link.  Please remember to describe the whole problem with full detail.Hope this answers your query.

"What causes chest pain after sarcoma treatment of under breast skin? I've been having pain under my arm on the right side along with pain in the right chest.  Some time ago I had a severe stabbing pain shoot across my chest and what felt like a burning sensation out my nipples.  Since then the chest pain has been getting progressively worse.

"Random nose bleeds through left nostril when exposed to strong smells, pressure on forehead and nasal bridge. Diagnosis? I get random nose bleed through my left nostril only...my blood pressure is normal when this happens...I have sinus problems...this mostly happen when I m exposed to strong chemical smells, perfumes or after i shower and start sneezing ....I don t get headaches or feel ill when this happens...just pressure on my forehead and at the bridge of my nose. What do you think could be some possible diagnosis?","Hello, I am unable to understand if the nose bleeds and the sinus problems happen together or are unrelated to each other. If they happen together, then it may be due to rhinosinusitis that you develop once you get exposed to string chemicals. If you get any rashes on contact to chemicals, then a type IV hypersensitivity is likely that can be proven NOT on blood tests but patch tests. If you dont get rashes, then you have (possibly) a hyperresponsive airway that can be better understood using a pulmonary function test using methacholine challenge. This allows us to understand whether you have a degree of asthma. The sinuses need to be viewed using a CT scan to ensure there are no other problems. Thanks."

"Suggest treatment for vomiting and loose motion in a child hello, I beg to state that my child who is 1year old is suffering from loose motion for 8 times and he had fever yesterday with 4 vomitings .Our doctor suggested us the medicines named calpol 250mg 3ml,vizylac 5ml,zincolife 5ml,ofloxacin &metronidazole 5 ml with the conclusion that the child os suffering from diarrhoea. We are feeding the baby with a solution of one cup water and one cup milk. I kindly request you to suggest me whether the medicines are preferable to give in such condition of baby and what are the foods to be given to him. thanking u asghar abbas","Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

What cause abdominal pain with random cramps and pelvic and back pain? Hi Im a 26 year old female. I had horrible abdominal pains about two weeks ago. I figured it was just a ruptured cyst. Which happens once a year and makes my period a few days late. Haven t had a period yet. I have random cramping and random pelvic pains and some back pain. Also have two negative home pregnancy test. What could be wrong?,"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would go for a gynaecological check up of yours to rule out a pelvic inflammatory disease which could give rise such symptoms of yours. I would advise you for a urine routine and microscopic test followed by a culture sensitivity test if need be for an associated UTI. Also a routine stool test for ova and cyst could be of help. As home pregnancy test is not a confirmatory test, I would also advise you for a serum HCG test. In case of ambiguity of the diagnosis, I would not hesitate to advise you for an ultrasound of abdomen including pelvis for reaching at a diagnosis. Further management would depend on the results of investigations. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

"Is electric shock treatment a normal procedure for treating decreased heart rate? My aunt just had a heart valve replacement and was released from the hospital about 2-3 days ago. I found out this evening that she is back in ICU. It s my understanding that her heartbeats that should be @ 100 drops to 50 and that they plan to shock her heart tomorrow! Is this normal procedure? Safe? and what does it all mean is going on? Thank you Bev I apologize, I am not financially able to pay for this service. Thanks anyway","Hi,According to the scenario you are telling I am expecting she has a irregular heart rate called as AF - Atrial Fibrillation which causes decreased cardiac output and is bad for patients especially those having a valve disease. If she does not have a clot in her heart and it is a new episode, we generally prefer to convert it into normal regular sinus rhythm which is done in two ways - medically or by giving a small intensity of shock. Giving shock is more effective. So I think this is what your doctors must be doing. I expect that was helpful to you and don't worry that shock is given when patient is sedated so she won't feel anything.Hope I have answered your query.

How to get rid of heart palpitation? i took crestor for about 6 months- 10 mg- since going off of it i have had heart palpations usuallyat nite- went to emerg room on memorial day weekend- they admitted me for 2 days said it was ad -fib- i think it was the crestor...i now take pravastin but still have the heart skips at nite also am taking a beta blocker and blood thinner now because of the skips pooling blood and do not want a stroke from it? what do you think?,"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.Crestor is a lipid lowering drug, it doesn't act on the heart and has no effect on heart beats. So it was not the cause. If you have Afib (atrial fibrillation) then it certainly does explain the heart skips, it is a type of heart rhythm abnormality. The beta blocker aims to control the rate of the heart but still may feel some palpitations.As for the stroke prevention, you have every right to be concerned, Afib is one of the main causes of stroke. For that matter taking a blood thinner to prevent it is essential. As for comments on the choice of the blood thinner (there are different types) and the dosage it is hard to make any suggestion since you do not say which blood thinner have you started and the dosage. I would be happy to approve or make suggestions if you provide more information.I hope to have been of help."

"What could severe pain in lower back while lying down mean? Im 17 years old, 140 pounds, and have had this problem ever since I can remember. Every time I lay down on my back I have severe lower back pain for about 15 minutes and then it stops and I am fine. I usually avoid this by sleeping on my side. Any suggestions?","Hello, Thanks for your query.It seems that your increase in weight; wrong body posture; inadequate exercise and reduced muscle tone is taking a toll on your back. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation).During the day don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.I suggest you to try back strengthening exercises by extension of the back muscles which can be taught by your Physiotherapist. This will help to relieve the possible muscle spasm which causes the pain. You may go for a physical examination by your Orthopedician to rule out any spine related pathology. You may be prescribed pain killers and/or muscle relaxants which should give you relief. Physiotherapy may also be advised if necessary. I would suggest you to try swimming as this will help most in back conditions.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"

"What does mild broncho vascular prominence mean? My daughter is of 16 mnths i have done x-ray, Reports are as follows Mild broncho vascular prominenceIs this 1st stage of pnuemonia??Dr suggested me to get admission in hospital and they will give some doses through saline (glucose)I m totaly confused what to do please help me Thanks in advance.","Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Increased bronchovascular markings are seen in bronchitis or viral infection. It is not suggestive of pneumonia. It suggests inflammation. Normally, airways are black and not seen clearly on chest x ray. They appeared black on x ray. But due to inflammation, airway walls are edamatous and blood supply in adjacent vessels is also increased. So airways and vessels become prominent on chest x ray and hence it is known as prominent bronchovascular markings. So it is not first stage of pneumonia. It is inflammed airways. If your daughter is having severe cough, breathlessness, wheezing, fever, chest pain etc than admission is needed. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks."

"Q. I have a bony lump on the side of my foot. Could it be malignant? Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old healthy woman. A few days ago, I noticed a small bony lump on the side of my foot below my ankle, which was not symmetrical on the other foot. It was a small sharp bony protrusion of around 1.5 mm and I could see it through my skin. I am very sure I did not have this thing before say one year ago or so. There was no pain when I touched it and no inflammation visible. I have attached a photo of it as well. You can easily see the pointy bony protrusion from that position. My question is can this be a benign bone spur or is it possibly something more serious? Is that spot on my foot typical for bone spurs? I have been walking a lot lately since I have a 10-month-old baby and I did feel my ankles getting a bit strained after each walk. Should I go to a doctor now or can I just monitor it and see what it does? Also, can bone spurs continue to grow or only malignant stuff do? Many thanks for any information.","Hello. This seems to be benign. So, you should not worry. This professional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of report or image and is based entirely on inputs provided to me.

All teeth decayed will not necessarily go for extraction, only after you get it checked you can have a idea on the treatment plan to be undergone.I would advice you to take your brother to the dentist for a check up and get the decayed teeth filled or have root canal treatment done after having an radiograph done.For the pain , he can have ibuprofen ( if he is not allergic to any medicines) and may also require antibiotics like amoxicillin after prescription from dentist.As there are decayed teeth ,leading to inability to eat properly will also effect his food habits and will cause related digestive problems Do not apply hot bag externally.Hope this was helpful.Thanks and regards."
"Q. Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

In fact when you have low hemoglobin such problems may happens. So breathlessness is because of severe anemia.I advice you to continue your therapy with iron. Iron therapy takes long time to get its effect. So please continue the medication. Take the medication till your hemoglobin sets to normal level plus three month. This extra three month will replenish your storage of iron.You can ask for further queries here on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious Disease specialistWe wish you a best health at health care magic."

This new Dr. said he wanted to lower my B.P. more, and they day I as in to see him it was a bit high 146/78 but no really that much out of line. He said he would like to see it 140/70 or less. The next day it was 131/68, and hadn t taken the prescription he recommended.

Suggest medicine to help fetal growth hi. i m sara i had a miscarriage last year june almost 8 weeks.and after 6th month at december i m again pregnanat but my baby not growing as yesterday s u/s reported i m 9 week pregnant but sac is only (6+2).i have no bleeding no pain.i feel hunger n gaining weight gradually. i waana ask is every thing ok/ or there r medicines that help fetal growth? plz reply thnx,"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are two possibilities that could be going on in your situation. The first, is that the pregnancy is actually younger than what would be expected based on your last menstrual period.The second, unfortunately, is that the fetus died during your six week of pregnancy and is just still remaining inside you. The tissue surrounding the pregnancy is what produces hormones that still give you pregnancy related side effects, even if the fetus is no longer developing.Furthermore, there is nothing that can be done to alter the potential outcome of this pregnancy. If it is destined to be a miscarriage there is no medical treatment that can prevent it. So there is no medication that can help the baby to grow or develop normally if it already has been lost.The only thing the can be done, is to watch and wait and see what happens. I would recommend that you have an ultrasound repeated in two weeks to see if the fetus has grown and has a heartbeat. If not, this pregnancy is a miscarriage that is just not passed yet from the body.The positive news, is that even with two miscarriages, there is a greater than 80% chance that the next pregnancy will be completely normal. If this turns out to be a miscarriage, your doctor may want to do some simple tests that can evaluate if you have any other risk factors that might've caused this to happen.I am very sorry about your situation, and I hope everything works out for the best.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"

There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others.  While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety.In your case, I see the fear and the associated physical symptoms (which are not present in actuality).

I suggest you psychotherapy and life style changes for management of your anxiety.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

"What prognosis is recommended for this chest CT scan result for signs of TB? I have had a year long plague of pneumonia with reason not found . An opacity in chest right upper lobe was found . Two bronchoscopies and one needle biopsy yielded no results .. although my symptoms were fever , weight loss , shortness of breath and cough that doesn t stop .. TB tests were negative ..No specific bacteria or fungi found during this time. They diagnosed this to be lung abcess and finally docs suggested me augmentin for several months which did kill all the symptoms but the mass in my chest would not go away completely .. surgery was advised and they were going to do a lobectomy but ended up doing a wedge resection .. now after a month of healing from this I m still having same symptoms and a CT still shows a mass or opacity in the upper lobe (right) . Doctors are suggesting a full lobe removal but my point is I have been through this once with no results .. what are the chances that this is a misdiagnosis and I have TB .. should I take a second opinion and treat for TB ?","Hello and Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor' service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, you should definitely go for second opinion. Recurrent mass like lesion on upper lobe is mostly due to 1. Tuberculosis. 2. Lung cancer.

But if mass is persistent then possibility of cancer is more likely. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

If your doctor has confirmed that you are not having any severe disease then I would think your symptoms due to environment change.Yes, you can take Telekast-L.

"Suggest medications for allergy Hello,I'm having an allergy to the moisturizer I apply to my skin legs and arms. It starting to irratate and its itchy, red and bumpy. What is the cure for this allergy? And the home remedies to lessen the itch on my legs and arms.Thanks,Jhoanna","**Even when starting with home remedies, make sure to get opinion of Dermatologist regarding the same.1. a. Boil about 25 grams of babul and mango barks each in one liter of water. Allow a fomentation of these vapors directly onto the affected part of the skin. When the fomentation is done, dab the region with ghee. The itchiness will slowly disappear.b. Mix linseed oil in equal parts of lemon juice. Apply this on the region where itching is severe. This remedy works for treating almost all types of itching.c. Mix the juice of a fresh coconut and a tomato. Massage this on the itchy region. The itchiness will fade away.d. If the itchiness is spreading all over the body, then you may try out the following recipe. Mix some ground red gram (arhar ki daal) in curds. Apply this on the skin for three to four days. The itching will stop spreading and will slowly disappear within a few days.e. Grind sandalwood and black pepper to a fine paste. Mix them in ghee. Apply them with a rough cloth onto the itchy skin. Then expose the skin to sunlight. This is a quick method for reducing the itching sensation, but it may be a temporary relief.f. Simply applying the juices of the root of bitter gourd (karela) on the skin also relieves itching to a great extent.g. You may ask for prescription medicine like: tablet septilin, arogya vardhini vati, sutshekhar ras, kamduddha ras,haridra khand.PS. True allergy to moisturisers and emollients is rare. Suspected contact allergy can be investigated by patch testing. But even if a patient's allergens are identified, their presence in commercial preparations can be difficult to ascertain and it often comes back to trial and error."

"Q. Why do periods get delayed after first time sex? Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time. After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

"What causes high blood pressure and extensive thirst? Last week I suddenly developed high blood pressure ranging from the 190 s over 90 s. I t hought it was too much salt in my recent diet and starting drinking water and watching my salt intake. My doctor doubled my enalipril beselate to 20 mg per day, but a week later the BP is just as bad and now I am drinking water because I am always thirsty.","HelloThanks for posting at HCM. Your BP is definitely high hence your doctor has doubled your enalapril dose. You have to wait for at least two weeks for the blood pressure to be under control. Drinking lots of water also increases the blood volume and contributes to high BP. Frequent thirst is a symptom of diabetes. Hence please check your fasting and post lunch blood sugars. If BP remains persistently higher despite increased dose of enalapril, a renal Doppler study and a 2 d echo should be done. Also an additional BP medication should be added in that case. wishing you good healthRegards"

I have the same burning sensation in the left arm, below the shoulder to forearm. I have heaviness in my legs with a sharp pain in the feet. It got started after taking Ativan. This burning is pretty new to me, and I have this problem for a week now. I also have loss of circulation in my left arm at night during sleep. What can I do now?","Hi. Your symptoms are related to anxiety or peripheral neuropathy. I have reviewed all your tests, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are perfectly normal. You have vitamin B12 level in a higher range, and it is not a problem. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing nerve conduction studies to investigate for neuropathy. I would also recommend checking magnesium plasma levels. If all these test results are normal, you can consider anxiety as a possible cause of your symptoms. In such a case, I would recommend adding Pregabalin or Gabapentin to your current therapy. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues."

How can I get my brother change his attitude of casual approach towards life ? Nowadays i am quite worried about my brother. He is 19 yrs old. At schooling he was above average student. From childhood he had sharp mind but casual approach Now he is in BCom 2nd year but he is still continuing that casual approach which leads his failure in 1st year. He wasted his one academic year and about to waste second. We tried to tell him in all the possible ways we know but in vain. We never forced him to take a particular field he has taken it on his own but god knows where the problem arises. My mother used to compare him with his friends and our cousins but now from last 1 2 yrs she stopped it as it may cause a depression . His behavior is becoming a cause for mental stress to my parents and so to me. Please suggest what to do.,"HiWelcome to HealthcareMagic.The medically related reasons for his bad performance in studies can be 1)some youngsters have thought disorders and learning difficulties that even they dont know.This makes them difficult to learn and so they avoid it.2)Drug abuse.These days drug abuse has become very common in teenagers and that remains as an addiction.When a person is addicted to a substance or habit , it is difficult for him to concentrate on other thingsPlease observe your brother and try to find if he has any difficulty in keeping his academics upto his level.At this age , the development of brain occurs in a way to be very flexible.The ideas and perspective towards his life that he gets now remains firm after 20s .So it is important he has a focus on what he really wants.Though it is difficult , it is possible to change a teenager`s behavior than a person of 20 s.thats evident by scientific studies too.I guess that helps you and all.If you need any help you can ask me.Take care"

"How can persistent cough and dizziness be treated? Every once and a while (2-5 times a week) I start coughing for no reason for like 10 seconds really loud and get really dizzy and light headed and feel like Im going to pass out, this last for about 15 seconds and hoes away into next time it happens","Hello, Coughing can cause vagal nerve stimulation and this can cause dizziness. So if we treat your cough, your dizziness will be treated. This kind of sudden onset cough is commonly seen with asthma. So in my opinion, you should get done a clinical examination of the respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about the severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). If PFT is normal then no need to worry much.

"What causes palpitations in the heart with numbness in the arms? For the past year I have been having heart palpitations along with other symptoms. I will list them now. -Heart Palpitations all day -Numbness in Arms every morning -Occasional, BAD Vertigo episodes (2-4 times a week) -Flash of light in just my right eye -Painful zit like sores on both legs inner thigh -Weakness of Grip in both hands -Pain in my left wrist and I occasionally cant push my thumb and index fingers together without it hurting a lot (this happens sometimes) I went to the doctor and wore a holter monitor and was told it was benign pvcs and it might be anxiety...but I felt something more serious was wrong. I got a 2nd opinion and got blood work done, and was told I tested postive and negatove for lyme disease. The test that determines if I have it now was negative, and the test that determines if ive ever had it was positive. I had never been diagnosed with lyme...so I may have had it for a while...not sure. Anyway, I took antiobiotics for a month and after 3 weeks on them my palpitations disappeared along with the weird zits on my thighs. I felt a little better and had joint pain still ..but not having the palpitations was a relief. I finished my dosage and about 3 weeks after I stopped...my palpitations came right back full force and the painful small boil/zits came back. I feel like all of these symptoms are related to one another...I dont know what I could have. Please, if theres anybody who can ask me a series of questions to help solve my lifes mystery id be forever grateful. Has anyone had identical symptoms? Or have any doctors on here dealt with similar cases? Im truly desperate. I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to read this. Thank you!","Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would like to explain that Lyme disease is a chronic disease, which can affect many systems of organs, including the heart, muscles, skin, central and peripheral nervous system etc. . Based on your symptomatology, the fact that you symptoms disappeared while on antibiotic therapy and reappeared, means that this is a chronic infection. Have you been tested for both antigens and antibodies of Lyme disease or only just antibodies?Sometimes the antigens can persist in the blood for years, indicating a chronic infection, even though the antibodies don't show this. I would recommend consulting with an infectious disease specialist for further tests for Lyme disease. An ambulatory 24-48 hour monitoring is necessary to examine your heart rhythm, for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If you were my patient, I would continue the treatment with antibiotics, as it seems that this resistant bacteria is still causing disturbances on your body organ function. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri"
Suggest treatment for brain cancer my brother is suffering from brain cancer since two months he is been given a chemotherapy and now the doctors are advising for the stem cell transplant.can you please give an advice on that.In the mean while it has come to my knowledge about an Adyar Cancer Institute in chennai who are giving free treatment as imitinet mercilet.please advice which option is the best possible treatment for the patient.thanks khurram,"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Stem cell therapy is newer advance in treatment of cancer. Cancer is basically group of cells which are constantly and vigorously growing. So in brain cancer brain cells are growing rapidly and causing mass lesion. So the main idea behind stem cell therapy is to develop new cells in the body which replace cancer cells. Stem cells are progenitor cells, from which all cells of the body develop. So by giving stem cells, possibility of development of new cells in place of cancer cells can be expected. So this is encouraging option in cancer treatment. You need to discuss in depth about its effectiveness and cost benefit ratio with your doctor. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your brother. Thanks."

What causes severe chest pain while on Urbanol? Hi I ve been having bad chest pain. Thought it was my heart. Went for a stress ECG that came back normal and blood test. I train everyday and have no problems with chest pain when training. I had a gastroscope and I have a hernia. Can this be causing numbness to my face and chest pain.

In my opinion, your anxiety is not fully controlled with Urbanol. And this uncontrolled anxiety causes chest pain, facial numbness etcetera. So better to consult a psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life, and start working on its solution. You will need additional anxiolytic drugs like propranolol or flunarizine. Don't worry you will be alright with all these. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

It is common to feel stressed following a break-up in any relationship. Usually one gets better with time, but you are reporting the ongoing stressful situation. It will get better with support. 2. Have you spoken about your difficult situation with any family member or friends? Try to open up and have an honest discussion with a trusted person who can understand and support you. 3. It does not help that the ex-guy is trying to defame you. Try to ignore him and see whether his actions die off. Block his contacts. Try to stay off social media for some time until everything calms down. If he continues to harass you, try to warn him formally. Take help from family and friends instead of handling it alone. 4. Try not to worry about the current stressful situation. You will come out of it as a wiser person. Try to stay positive. Focus on long term goals. Try to exercise regularly to help you to relax. Distract yourself by listening to your favorite music, watching TV, movies, etc. 5.

"Can i give calpol,vizylac,atarex,distaclor and tustel for high fever? Hi my child is 13 months old and is suffering from high fever 103.5 F doctor has advised foll medicines he is suffering from fever since last 4 days kindly suggest wheather the prescription is right or not,Calpol 250VizylacAtarexDistaclor 125Tustel txThanks,Jitendra Jadhav","Hi... I feel it is too many medicines for a simple viral illness. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

"What causes painful lumps on the legs and arms in an elderly person? I am a 76 year old woman who began to lose weight for no reason . I lost my appetite but have gotten it back now to some degree but not my weight.I have a lot of test and they only showed that I was lacking in magnesium so I am taking this now , so far I am still low in it I have lumps under my skin on my legs and arms which I was told by one Dr. it is nothing to worry about , Having researched this I have found out it could indeed be cancer. I will be seeing an oncologist in a couple weeks , I have had cancer before and radation but it did not advance any more.I look in the face very thin and my eyes look very weak , I do not feel well at all ,Could this weight loss and lumps mean there is a cancer in my body? thank you","Hi.Thanks for your query.Noted the history and understood your concerns.Loosing weight for no obvious reason that the low magnesium but with history of cancer that got treated by Radiotherapy although you have not mentioned the details of it can be due to recurrence of cancer.But there is no cancer that can have so many lumps in the legs and arms; these could have been lipomas that got visible due to loss of weight. The only sure-shot way is to get this ultrasound, FNAC and/or biopsy to confirm the cause of these lumps. Most important looks to be re-evaluation of the past cancer whether there is any recurrence and to get a confirmed diagnosis. Stress, anxiety and such mental conditions can cause the problems. Since you have mentioned that other tests are normal, we can take that you do not have diabetes, thyroid or liver related problems the cause of weight loss. Take care, anyways a visit to an Oncologist will help further to clarify."

"Q. How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine? Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

"Had elevated liver levels. Scan report showed multiple cysts in the liver and fatty infiltration. Suggestions? Hello, Dr. Grief.. My husband had elevated liver levels on his last blood draw in late August this summer and was advised to have an abdomenal ultrasound (he had it last Thursday), which indicated ""multiple cysts in the liver (2 in the right and 1 in the left)"".  The largest is 7.7cm.  Also the words ""fatty infiltration"" and ""liver cellular disease"" were read to us by our primary care physician's nurse from the report when she called to say the doctor recommends having a CT scan.  Can you tell us how serious this may be?  He is 73 years old, is 6 feet tall and weighs about 225 lb. I know his BMI is under 33 but don't recall exactly what it is without pulling out his last blood work up (done the end of August this summer). He does not drink alcohol at all.  He has diabetes 2, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.  He currently takes 1,000 mg. of Metformin twice per day, 50 mg. of Metoprolol in the morning, 50 mg. of Losartan Potassium at night, 20 mg. of Simvastatin at night, and 0.4 mg. of Tamsulosin at night.  He also takes Zyrtec for allergies at night.  Thank you, Sandy Nickora","Hi and welcome to HCM.Liver cysts are usually benign and no treatment is necessary if there is no symptom or rapid grow of cyst or sogn of malignancy.The most common liver disorders is fatty liver which can be found in healthy people, but usually is resulting from elevated blood lipids, overweight and elevated blood sugar. If ultrasounds didnt find anything and viral markers are negative then you have no reason to be concerned. YOu should treat it by changing dietary and lifestyle habits. Do exercise, avoid alcohol, smoking, fats, fast food and carbonated drinks. Eat more fruit and vegetables, boiled meat and follow some of hepatoprotective diets. Findings usually improves on such measures. If not, then some medicines can be prescribed, but I suggest to go step by step. If you dont have any symptoms then this is just slight and reversible liver damage.Wish you good health."
"How safe is using lotrimin for itchiness and cut due to masturbation? Hello. recently I have masturbated and noticed later on that I have gotten some cuts. These cuts itches at times and reddens. One of the cut became a little bump and does not go away. I have tried putting some lotion and other ointments, but none seems to work. I figured I should keep it dry, but it just remains as a red lump. I have done my research and found out this is a fungal/yeast problem and I am wondering if lotrimin will work.

"What is the cause of pain in the face and jaw with a spider beside him? My husband has just woken up in agony with a bump on his temple. Next to the bed there was a large brown spider. He feels the pain in his entire face, especially his jaw. There is no rash, he has no problems breathing and has taken a pain killer but is still in a lot of pain. What should we do?","Hi Lady, Thanks for your query. Though you have not mentioned about the presence of bite marks, I presume that he had had a spider sting at the site of bump. Firstly, try to see if there is a sting (a hair-like minute object) in the bump. If present, or you can feel it, remove it with a needle. Thereafter, in view of the strong likelihood of spider venom been infected in the skin, immediately start with *  an anti-histaminic, such as, cetirizine 10mg thrice daily for 2-3 days (with the first dose immediately); *  Tablet Prednisolone (5mg) Two tablets straight away and thereafter, two tablets thrice daily for 2-3 days till the symptoms go away. *  An anti-inflammatory pain-killer, such as, a combination of ibuprofen + Paracetamol, a tablet thrice daily for 2-3 days. It will take 24-72 hours for the entire symptoms to go away.

I will be very much thanks ful of for your prompt reply.

Testosterone is secreted by interstitial cells and that is not affected by azoospermia. Hydrocele as a cause of azoopermia is debatable and you have got only unilateral problem. There is no proven remedy-natural/surgical/medical that can really show efficacy to correct sperm count. I hope that answers your query."

Also getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are co-infected with HIV, then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B.

"Q. Why do periods get delayed after first time sex? Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time. After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

"Q. Is it fine to have no toe movement after foot injury while playing? Hello doctor, Injured foot in football four days back, badly bruised, very little pain but now have no movement in the fourth toe.","Hello. Sorry to hear about the injury. The first thing you should do now is to take an X-ray for a safety case. Ignoring cannot be beneficial. Usually, the fracture is uncommon but still have to take an X-ray to rule out any fracture possibility. Also, for now, do icing and stabilize the part. In case if it is fracture you may find some discoloration of the skin in that area and need immediate attention. Always use the RICE protocol in injuries which can avoid major damage to soft tissue. Please take up an X-ray and if X-ray reveals no fracture then we can guide for home care therapy for the same. Please get back after taking up an X-ray. Sports injury. X-ray. Fracture. Ligament sprain. RICE. Immobilize the part."

HaiDoctor, My brother in law 34 year old underwent surgery for tumor in left cheek upto back of left ear now he is recomendedto  have radotherapy , now may i know that can he had treatment in adayar centre ,do they do free of cost or is it a paid service.","Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat. It might take months to years for complete treatment and to say that the patient is cured. It is a usual practice to give radiation to a person operated for cancer cheek like your brother.The surgery has been done to remove the bulk of tumor and the radiation is to treat any microscopic cancer cells in the cheek. Radiation is calculated as per the area to be treated and is given with the help of highly precise machines. It will also treat the cancer cells in areas where complete removal by surgery is not possible. Radiation is administered by giving fraction doses over days to weeks.

"Can a combination of Deriphyllin and tricot be used as injection for asthma? i'm in a consultation of a drug of related to asthamaCan a combination of Deriphyllin and tricot used as injection for asthama. my family friends used and got cured, since last 4 yr they didnt got asthama. it worked and they suggested me to use it. i'm 55yr old. can i go for it????? help me","hello,thanks for your query, tricot is a steroid injection, contraindicated in diabetics and several medical conditions. if you are severe asthmatic , you need to go for nebulisations and inhalers. in my opinion, you continue prophylactic drugs like montelukast (after consulting ent/ chest consultant) and reserve inhalers for acute status. i feel for asthma nebulisers and inhalers are fast acting when compare to oral medications. anyway visit an ent surgeon for maintaince treatment. hope i have answered your query. all the best. take care."
"Suggest treatment for fever in case of viral cold My son was diagnosed with a viral cold at the docs office yesterday. He since then has reached temps as high as 104.8 and the low is about 99-100. He threw up today and I wondered if it's normal to throw up with a cold. Also, he isn't eating, he ate 1/2 of an individual container of applesauce today. He is drinking a lot of milk, some water. After he threw up his mood was much better, but his temp is still high 102.4 before bed.","Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query your son have persistent fever ranging from 99-104 degree due to viral infection because your son's  immunity is getting lowered down and making him prone to  viral infections. I would suggest you to take combination of antiviral drug such as Famicyclovir  along with anti-inflammatory drug such as Benadryl. You should give NSAID's along with paracetamol as well. Take diet rich in multivitamins and vitamin C. Your symptoms will resolve in 4-5 days. If symptoms keeps on persisting visit ENT specialist once and get some routine blood investigation done. You should do tepid sponging on your child's head to lower down body temperature. Avoid hot, spicy and sharp food substances.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"

"Q. Kindly tell the treatment for acid reflux due to Vitamin B12 intake. Hello doctor, My question is as follows. I have low B12 tested at blood laboratory. I have been taking B12 for over three years off and on as directed by my doctor (sublingual). Now every time I take B12 with food or without the acid reflux is so very bad. I have to some times take medication to calm the acid reflux. Is there anything I can do?","Hi. I understand all your concerns. Acid reflux is one of the adverse effects of taking Vitamin B12 supplements. I suggest that you test the vitamin B12 level as you have already taken supplements for three years. In case of mild deficiency, I suggest that you take foods rich in Vitamin B12 like clams and liver and stop the supplements. For acid problems, I suggest antacids like Maalox (Calcium carbonate) after meals."

"Q. How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine? Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

"Q. I have been burping with stomach pain and discomfort. What can be the reason? Hi doctor, Since the past four years, I am having a lot of stomach problems. It all started with loose motions at that time, and I used to take Ciplox-OZ or Norflox-OZ over-the-counter, and I used to feel better for two to three months. After a year, I started having acid reflux and burning sensation in my stomach. So, the doctor prescribed Rabeprazole D, which helped solve. But after two to three years I started burping a lot (nearly 10-20 burps after meals), with stomach discomfort and sometimes prickling pain. My stomach used to bloat immediately after meals, so the doctor gave me Zenflox-OZ, Unienzyme, Becelac-PB, Meftal-Spas, and Aristozyme. All these medicines helped treat my symptoms, but it recurred as soon as I stopped taking Zenflox-OZ. I am under Petril-MD 0.5 mg for anxiety and pure obsessional OCD. Whenever I get bloating and burping, anxiety also follows. My ultrasound reports were also normal apart from fatty liver. I am afraid to undergo endoscopy because of panic attack problem. Please help me.","Hi. After going through your concerns carefully, I feel your symptoms may be due to any one of the following. I suggest you tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg and Zenflox-OZ (combination of Ofloxacin and Ornidazole) for 14 days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take treatment with consent. The fact that your symptoms disappear after taking Zenflox-OZ, it means that your symptoms are due to large or small bowel infections. I would suggest you do hydrogen breath test to rule out or confirm small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. For further queries consult a medical gastroenterologist online -->"

"Suggest treatment for lump in  the rib cage Hello. I am looking for someone to help me find an answer. I have been having pain on my right side of my abdomen for a while. I just recently noticed a lump that is deep about 2 inches below my rib cage and closer to the center of my stomach. It is hard to push on and is movable as well. It does hurt or ache when I push on it, but it is in the spot where my pain starts. I have pain every day. I have learned to tolerate it the best I can, but I am getting tired. An abdominal ultrasound was normal. CBC, CMP, sed rate, CRP and celiac panel were all normal. I do not have other symptoms of gallbladder problems. I've seen my PCP multiple times and a GI doctor this past Tuesday. He set me up for a HIDA scan on Monday, but disregarded the lump as a possible clump of fat cells. My mother had stage 4 pancreatic cancer so I find myself freaking out about feeling a lump. My husband, coworkers, fellow doctors I work with have felt it. I just need help and I don't want to waste all this money on a wild goose chase with no answer. Please help!!!","Welcome to health care magic. 1.The history and symptoms suggest that the lump what you are feeling could be the xiphisternum, which is normal anatomical condition - if there was a mass ultrasound would have been picked. 2.The pain in that region most commonly are gastric causes / ulcers and inflammatory condition.3.Treatment in this case includes having small portions of food in frequent in intravel of time regularly will help. 4.Avoid junk,spicy,fat containing food and take more of fruits and salads, fibrous diet for better bowel moment - that should help, you try at least couple of weeks.5.If you have a suspicion and you want to clear once for all - then CT abdomen is right choice - that will clear all your suspicion and help to find any underlying pathology.

"Q. Why am I having swelling and pain in penis after scrotoplasty? Hello doctor, Two weeks ago I had a scrotoplasty. Accompanied with this was liposuction (around lower stomach and inside of thighs towards the groin) to thicken the penis. Operation went well. Had general swelling and edema of the penis and scrotum with pain. I have been taking anti-inlfammatory tables, antibacterial antibiotics and pain killers. One of the symptoms I have had is pain in my penis when I stand. It is like the blood rushes to that area and cause discomfort. I then lie back down and the pain subsides. Based on this I have just been resting. I noticed yesterday when feeling the scrotum that my left testicle has swollen. I am guessing it is about two inches long by 1.5 inches wide in the shape of an egg. It is not soar to touch, but feels hard. The scrotum or stiches do not show any signs or reddness and the scrotum appears to be okay in color. I have not had a fever or vomiting. I have read different reports on line as to why this could be like fluids draining from liposuction into scrotum, severe edema, orchitis, etc. And advice would be appreciated?","Hi.  First of all I would like to inform you that size mentioned by you is within normal range and it should not be called swelling unless there is gross difference from other side. The average testis size is 3 to 5 cm in length and 3 to 4 cm in width. Now, regarding feeling hard, this is completely normal after scrotoplasty as there is mild deem of testicular skin along with testis itself. This may take almost 4-6 weeks to completely disappear. I feel this is normal complication of surgery as there is no fever, no tenderness, no redness (sighs of inflammation). I would like to inform you that keeping scrotal support and proper rest may help you. In case this continues to remain in same stage sort aggravates with time it will be ideal to see your doctor and get examined. Regarding other symptoms related to pain at the tip of penis I feel this is due to clogging of secretions in urethra which creates problem. In my opinion excess intake of water and fluids may help you."

Nothing to worry about your childs health. As you gave your child Tylenol, that is proper for him. But please inform the mg of the drug on healthcaremagic which you gave to him. Though 250 mg of Tylenol, 3 times in a day, at the interval of 7-8 hours is a proper dose. It will help to decrease the fever. Give cold sponge if fever will increase higher than 100 degree. Tylenol will also help to decrease the headache.If I would come across to these type of patients in my clinic, I would definitely suggest Syrup Meftal-Spas 5 ml 3 times per day (if no allergy) for relief in abdominal pain. For pink patches on trunk, give syrup Levocetrizine 5 ml daiy at night (if no allergy).Consult pediatrician.

I have chronic pain from degenerative disc disease & my back is usually ""under control"" with exercise & being aware of how I move.  However, occasionally it will become very painful.  In the morning, I take Synthroid 25mcg  for a recently diagnosed thyroid problem....Thank You!",Hi Thank you for your question.Cyclobenzaprine is a muscle relaxant whereas meloxicam is an antiinflammatory medication. Both have different mechanisms of action. Use of these medications particularly cyclobenzaprine for long periods is not recommended. Occasional use of these to keep pain under control is fine. However it is recommended that you consult your doctor before starting any new medication as the close monitoring is needed for side effects.Hope this is helpful.

Wanted to know how much I should feed formula milk to him and what would be the diet plan. Please help.","Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.At his age interest in play increases and interest in food decreases. This is quite natural. If he is active and playing around you need not worry. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed him and also make whatever you feed him calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.This is not related to teething. If your kid is active and developmentally normal, please do not worry.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

"What do the following test reports indicate? hello doctors, may i ask clinical interpretation about my chest pa result. findings states that i have mild prominence of the broncovascular markings. heart is not enlarged.inact diaphragm and costophrenic angles.. kindly interpret so i may know if whats going on with my condition. thank you. ann","Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for your chest x ray report. Mild prominence of bronchovascular markings (BVMs) can be a normal finding if you are totally asymptomatic and nonsmoker. But if you are having cough, expectoration or breathing difficulty then possibility of viral bronchitis is more. If you are smoker then you should get done PFT to rule out smoking related lung damage because this can also show prominent BVMs. So if you are asymptomatic and nonsmoker then no need to worry for chest x ray report. But if you are smoker and symptomatic then quit smoking as soon as possible and consult pulmonologist for treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

I advise you to not pinch or pop the area otherwise these areas are very prone for getting secondary infection. You can apply an steroid cream such as cortisone cream. If itching is present then can take benadryl accordingly. Apply a plenty of moisturizers over the affected area. If these increase the n consult a dermatologist for higher treatment"

"Will having Merina IUD help cure heavy bleeding? I am 53.  I have a Merina IUD that was inserted a year ago to stop my heavy periods.  I have recently had an ultrasound that indicates a thickening of my uterus, 9mm.  Apparently this is abnormal for menopausal women.  Is it abnormal for premenopausal women with this IUD?  I would have thought the IUD would prevent thickening.","Hi,This thickening of the endometrium is definitely abnormal in the menopausal uterus while it is under normal limits for a peri-menopausal woman. Mirena contains hormone and hence helps to control the duration and amount of bleeding. It does thin the endometrium. In the current scenario, you need further monitoring to see if the Mirena is really working or not. If there is a persistent rise in the endometrial thickness, you may need to have further investigation. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."

How long should tablets for anxiety disorder and palpitions be taken? sir i have anxiety disorder for that i have taken antidepression tablets for the past 5 years and also have palpitation 90 to 100 per minutes i am taking propornalal 20 mg three time a day.the doctor adviced me that take the tablets till i say.how long shall i take the tablets and is the palpitation rate is normal?( now i am free psych problem ),"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.There is no strict time duration for continuing anti-anxiety / anti-depressant medication. This depends on a number of factors like nature and severity of the symptoms, response to treatment, present level of functioning, etc. Since you have been on medication for the past 5 years and that you are symptom-free and doing well now, a gradual reduction in medication can be tried. However, it is best that this is done under the supervision of your doctor. So, I would suggest that you discuss about this with your doctor so that the further course of action can be decided.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"
"What is the substitute for asthma pax depot? My mom is 66 years old and she is having Asthma since last 20 years, she was taking Asthma pax depot for last so many years but now we have stopped due to high pulse rate ( because of this medicine as suggested by doctor,) but her condition is becoming bad, can you please suggest","Hi.I appreciate your concern for your beloved Mom.I went through the history given in your query it seems to me that Asmapax Depot (Ephedrine, Phenobarbitone, Theophylline) is not an ideal medication to relieve her asthmatic attack of difficulty in breathing or wheezing, etc.The fact that the drugs like Ephedrine and Theophylline which are present in Asmapax Depot can cause increased or irregular heart beats, palpitations, agitation, tremors, irritability so, they should not be used.I would suggest her a Salbutamol inhaler which is more effective in relieving the symptoms of difficulty in breathing or wheezing but having a less tendency to increase the heart beat.So, Salbutamol can be an alternate but safer medication for her.If her symptoms aggravate she must be examined by a doctor for the possibility of giving steroid injection to reduce the symptoms of asthma.Hope I could answer your query."
"How to get pregnant with high prolactin levels? Hi Doctor, I am an 27 year women and had not got my periods from past 10 years with out the medicines. i hev cheched the thyroid every thing is ok but i have the prolactine proble, my prolactine problem is very high and now i want to conceve pl help me as to what should i do?","hi , How are you doing ?Ovulation is under control of many hormones. Prolactin is one of them. This hormone is elevated during breast feeding, so there is no ovulation during this period & you don't get pregnancy. This hormone is from a small area in brain. If you want to get pregnant, you need ovulation, so you need proper levels of Prolactin. If levels are very high >200 ng/ml you need t get investigated . Reconfirm that Thyroid profile is normal & you are not on any other medications. have a MRI to rule out any micro or macroadenomas. Treatment will depend upon the finding . If levels are not very high, you can control prolactin with oral medications like Cabergolin or BromocryptinHope I have clarified your queries, do write back if any more queries.All the bestDr.Balakrishnan"

The swelling that I can see in the photo of yours (attachment removed to protect patient identity) can be one of the two things: Given that it has been there with you for seven years, tells me that it is a benign swelling. You will need to see a doctor about the swelling if: Regarding the floaters, I suggest you see a doctor as soon as you can. They are suggestive of posterior segment disorders and will need to be examined after dilating your pupils. For more information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->"

"What does inexplicable pain in the lower abdomen along with nausea and vomiting indicate? I have been lower abdominal/pelvic pain for 9 weeks now. I initially went to the ER when it started and the doctor was 99% sure it was appendicitis but my scan was negative, was sent home with an rx for pain meds and antinausea meds. I went back 2 days later because the pain had gotten worse and had another scan to check again for appendicitis, again it was negative. The doctor then suggested he thought it may be GI related to follow up with a GI doctor. I have since been seen by a GI doctor who performed an EGD and colonoscopy, said he couldn t find a reason gor the pain. I had another scan performed with IV dye and had to drink contrast to check for possible hernias, this scan was also negative.

"Excruciating pain all over the body after lumbar puncture hit sciatic nerve. Suggestions? Hi: I had a lumbar puncture with flouroscopy Friday afternoon. Now, two days later, I have excruciating pain all over my body, especially my legs. There is also pain in right flank at diaphragm, and hurts when I breath. Upon puncturing the lumbar area, I experienced an electric strong pain in my right sciatic nerve that shot down radiating to my right foot causing my leg to kick once uncontrollably. I said oh I think you hit my sciatic nerve! When the Dr pulled back on the needle, the pain stopped, but the leg felt numb. The pain was not this bad yesterday, but now even with my very potent meds for chronic back pain, the pain is very bad. I am stuck in bed and starting to get head and neck pain too. I have some arachnoiditis in the lumbar area from four spinal surgeries at L5 - S1. The radiology Dr said my cord area is very narrow as it was very difficult to obtain CSF. The puncture was done prone for the xray and then I had to roll onto left side for collection of CSF. It was barely dripping out. It took about 30 min. to get 6 cc. Is this pain normal?? I see many people on the site talking about the needle hitting the sciatic nerve, and the xray tech said it happened a lot at the facility I went to....Is it common that the sciatic nerve is hit upon needle entry? I would appreciate any advise as it is Sunday..... everything closed but ER.","Hi,Your symptoms suggest that you have experienced two side-effects of the lumbar puncture. Firstly, you have experienced some nerve irritation or damage during the procedure. This is likely to recover but may take a few days to show an improvement. It is a recognised occurrence during a lumbar puncture. Secondly, the head, neck and body pain that has started is also due to the puncture but is not nerve damage. It is due to leakage of CSF through the hole made by the needle and, again, is a recognised problem with a lumbar puncture. My suggestion is that you continue to take your pain meds. Lie down and rest as this may relieve the head and neck ache to some degree. Keep well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Caffeinated drinks will also help with the pain. These measures are likely to ease the pains.If you do not feel significantly better in 24 hours, I suggest you contact the clinic where you had the procedure done for further advice. I hope you feel better soon.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"
